A shell script is a **computer program** designed to be run by the Unix shell, a command-line interpreter. The various dialects of shell scripts are considered to be scripting languages.

**What is Flask**

Flask is a microframework for Python based on Werkzeug, Jinja 2 and good intentions.

Flask is a micro web framework written in Python. It is classified as a microframework because it does not require particular tools or libraries and is mostly used to build small application with simpler requirements.
